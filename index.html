  I love Journaling because it gives me peace. I love to write all my plans in a book. And then design that book in a very creative way. I also love to read my old plans. While I read my old plans I laugh at myself on my silly plans that was in the book. I personally have my own Journal. And one of the benefits of journaling is that it keeps me systamitic in my schedule, home economics, studies, coding, and all that stuff which creates a routine. It is like, Whenever am free I just pick up my Journal and start making my plans.You should also try it and you would find profit and profit in it.!!! </p>
